**"Is agile dead?"**
This phrase has come up in my discussions multiple times now. There was also a study making the rounds, which claimed that <a href="https://drj.com/industry_news/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds/">Agile projects are 268% more likely to fail</a>. Whether there is merit to that claim or not, listening to the stories of people, the pain seems to be real!

Before we write off agile though, let us verify if what we are doing is what agile was meant to be! I will try to share my knowledge and hopefully it helps ease the pain!

### Before we begin

Here is what [Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/), the creator of Story Points, concluded in his [blog post](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/019-01ff/story-points/Index.html). It is a good read if you want to know the full history of how the term was coined.

> Well, if I did invent story points, I’m probably a little sorry now, but not very sorry. I do think that they are frequently misused and that we can avoid many pitfalls by not using story estimates at all. If they’re not providing great value to your team or company, I’d advise dropping them on the grounds that they are waste. If, on the other hand, you just love them, well, carry on!

There are better alternatives to story points but in this post, I want to focus on the ‘how not to misuse them' part. It maybe easier to fix story points based estimations than to move away from it.

### Human Brain & Measuring things

Our brains are amazing at many things and suck at so many other things. Accurate measurements are one of the things we suck at after a limit.

Let's do an experiment.

Look at someone around you, try to guess their weight or height, don't judge, just guess. Odds are you would not be off by much.

Now look at the photo below (Photo by [David Rodrigo](https://unsplash.com/@david__r?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/aerial-photo-of-city-highway-surrounded-by-high-rise-buildings-Fr6zexbmjmc?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash))

Try to answer the following:

- How much does Building 1 weigh?
- How much does Building 1 weigh compared to Building 2?

Almost certainly you struggled with question 1. How do you answer it? It depends on so many things! If you come up with a number, it is most likely a random guess & you are way off.

But question 2 might have been easier to answer. I came up with somewhere between 1.5 to 2x. This was much faster to do, almost no processing power was needed & I am reasonably certain that I am not too far off. I am not super accurate, but should be with in tolerable limits.

Our brains are good at comparing things!

This is how story points are supposed to be used. As a comparison & not a conversion between person days and a number.

### Putting it in practice

Here are some tips to establish it in a new team or even reestablish it in an existing team.

- Estimate things from day 1, but don't give it too much thought, just use a number that comes to mind.
- Use the comparison method to calibrate your scales. Go through the stories that were delivered & try to find your scale. Pick up a story that was the max the team could do in the iteration timebox, something that was really small & somethings in the middle. Iterate over it a couple of times and you will find your reference scale for 1, 3, 5, 8 & 13 quickly. (scale for example, as most of the teams end up on this spectrum anyway)
- Use the references to estimate, instead of trying to estimate ‘complexity’. Complexity is not tangible, comparison of things that need to be done is easier.
- The last step is vital. Don't let your velocity dictate your reference scale or estimate. Velocity is a derived metric, not a defined one.
