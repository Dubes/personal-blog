# "Is agile dead?"

This phrase has come up in my discussions and feed multiple times now. There was also a study making the rounds, which claimed that <a href="https://drj.com/industry_news/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds/">Agile projects are 268% more likely to fail</a>.

I don't think agile is dead. It is alive, relevant & desperately needed. However I do see many agile teams struggle. My theory is that in the rush to transform, people lost sights of the foundation, history of the diverse set of practices that make agile work.

When I work with my teams, many of the discussions are around agile practices. How we work & interact is closely related to the technology we use. They have to go hand in hand in order to produce the outcome we desire.

This particular blog post is an opinion piece. Opinions I hold loosely. Opinions I am willing to change with new experiences and information. I will also try to share my practical advice but as separate posts so that they don't get diluted with opinions.

# Agile & Scaling

Can agile be scaled? Should agile be scaled?
I do not have strong opinions on this, at least none worth adding to the many opinions out there. What I can attest to is that there is a _need_ for agility. Enterprises are not the only ones who need it. Businesses of today need to embrace the digital world. Becoming a [modern digital business](https://www.thoughtworks.com/perspectives/edition8-modern-digital-business) needs a lot of mindset shift. There is no recipe to follow, only bets to be made. Agility is one of the key bets.

This realization has created a huge demand. Demand that cannot be realistically met, but market has responded. I think the issue is not that of scaling agile, rather can we scale the supply of _Agilists_?

# Scaling the supply of Agilists

When the demand is this overwhelming, many people try to fill it, not all of them are qualified to do so. Companies responded by insisting on credentials and certification. This led to a rush for getting certified, as it was now seen as a necessity to get into this field. I think this is where it started to go wrong.

Certifications and trainings existed before the rush. People who did it back then, did it because they wanted to learn. They were driven by curiousity than a need. I remember because I was one of them. My learning cohort, my trainer were all there because we were fascinated by the world Agile practices could create. I distinctly remember the feeling, we can do so much more with such little complexity and overhead!

But when there is a rush for certifications, most of the people don't do them for learning. Incentives are different, these incentives do not encourage learning, they value the certification.

# Can agile be taught?

My wonderful colleague Birgitta, mentioned that "Agile is counter-intuitive". This is the truth that seem to have been forgotten.
There is no formula for agile, if there was one, agile would not be counter-intuitive, you could follow that formula and your intuitions.

Agility means stepping away from the norms and processes, looking for what is not working, finding out what can be improved and trying to improve it. If you are part of the setup that created the norms, your intuitions will hold you back from improving, as they were the ones which introduced the problems in the first place.

This cannot be taught in a course or a couple of seminars. One should look at amassing a lot of tools and techniques. Sharing and learning from experiences. Leveraging those around you.

# Conclusion

I think a good agile team is organized like a professional kitchen. A chaotic, but organised hive. Everyone has their stations and responsibility, but information flows efficiently & people know how to react to it.

This is not how majority of the teams labelled as 'Agile teams' function. They are designed to function more like an assembly line. Stations with clear boundaries, but minimal touch points. Trying to create focus by managing capacity instead of cultivating focus. Focussing more on handovers than optimizing the information flows.

Agile is not dead, it is misunderstood, mislabelled, rushed and badly cultivated.
