**"Is agile dead?"**
This phrase has come up in my discussions and feed multiple times now. There was also a study making the rounds, which claimed that <a href="https://drj.com/industry_news/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds/">Agile projects are 268% more likely to fail</a>.

I don't think agile is dead. It is alive, relevant & desperately needed. However I do see many agile teams struggle. My theory is that in the rush to transform, people lost sights of the foundation, history of the diverse set of practices that make agile work.

### Outline

- The need for agility & thus transformation
- The monetization of agile
- The scaling of agile
- Human tendencies
