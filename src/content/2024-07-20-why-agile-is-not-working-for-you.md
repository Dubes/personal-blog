# Why is agile not working for your teams?

It is evident that digital transformation is a top priority for most organizations today. While significant resources are being allocated to this endeavor, many agile teams are struggling. Instead of steady progress and improved flow, there is often frustration. Some have even gone so far as to question the efficacy of agile methodologies, few are even claiming that "Agile is dead".

I believe that agile remains a vital and relevant approach. However, the difficulties faced by teams are undeniable. My hypothesis is that the rapid pace of transformation has overshadowed the fundamental principles and diverse practices that make agile practices wonderful & fruitful.

In my interactions with teams, discussions frequently revolve around agile practices. It is clear that the way we work and collaborate is intrinsically linked to the technology we employ. Both have to go hand in hand in order to produce the outcome we desire.

This blog post offers my perspective on the current state of agile. Opinions I hold loosely. Opinions I am willing to change with new experiences and information. I will also try to share my practical advice but as separate posts so that they don't get diluted with opinions.

# Agile & Scaling

The debate surrounding the scalability of agile methodologies has been going on for a while now.

Businesses of today need to embrace the digital world. Becoming a [modern digital business](https://www.thoughtworks.com/perspectives/edition8-modern-digital-business) necessitates a fundamental shift in mindset. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, only strategic choices to be made. Agility is undoubtedly a key element in this strategy.

This realization has created a huge demand. Demand that cannot be realistically met, but one that the market had to respond to. While I think the discussions on scaling of Agile methodologies is a valid one, perhaps the more crucial question is: can we effectively scale the supply of _skilled agilists_ to meet this need?

# Scaling the supply of Agilists

When the demand is this overwhelming, many people try to fill it, not all of them are qualified to do so. Companies responded by insisting on credentials and certification. This led to a rush for getting certified, as it was now seen as a necessity to get into this field. I think this is where it started to go wrong.

Certifications and trainings existed prior to this influx of people. Key difference was the incentive.

People who did certifications and training prior to the influx, were intrinsically motivated by a desire to learn and explore the potential of agile methodologies. I recall a shared enthusiasm among my peers and instructors for the transformative power of agile practices. We were captivated by the prospect of the world where we can achieve significant outcomes with such little complexity & overhead. Agility made us feel seen as humans with ideas than machines with tasks.

However, the current emphasis on certifications has shifted the focus from learning to credential attainment. The incentives associated with certification often prioritize memorizing the document over the underlying knowledge and skills.

# Can agile be taught?

My wonderful colleague Birgitta, mentioned that "Agile is counter-intuitive". This is the truth that seem to have been forgotten.
There is no formula for agile, if there was one, agile would not be counter-intuitive, you could follow that formula and your intuitions.

Agility means stepping away from the norms and processes, looking for what is not working, finding out what can be improved and trying to improve it. If you are part of the setup that created the norms, your intuitions will hold you back from improving, as they were the ones which introduced the problems in the first place.

This cannot be taught in a course or a couple of seminars. One should look at amassing a lot of tools and techniques. Sharing and learning from experiences. Leveraging those around you.

# Conclusion

I think a good agile team is organized like a professional kitchen. A chaotic, but organised hive. Everyone has their stations and responsibility, but information flows efficiently & people know how to react to it.

This is not how majority of the teams labelled as 'Agile teams' function. They are designed to function more like an assembly line. Stations with clear boundaries, but minimal touch points. Trying to create focus by managing capacity instead of cultivating focus. Focussing more on handovers than optimizing the information flows.

Agile is not dead, it is misunderstood, mislabelled, rushed and badly cultivated.
