excerpt: 'Introduction to the challenge. Building my website only using the browser!'
---

A long time ago, I came across the website [webflow](https://webflow.com/). I had a very basic knowledge of CSS, HTML and JS back then. I wanted to have a website of my own and webflow looked promising, but it was early in its days and it was quite tedious to maintain blogs as individual pages, so that idea fizzled out.

Fast forward to 2018. I gained more experience with the technologies and got to work with React, which really made the whole thing _click_ for me! I followed the developments in the ecosystem and two projects really caught my attention. [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) and [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io).

With [@compuives](https://twitter.com/compuives) adding [features](https://twitter.com/CompuIves/status/1045393192114409473) to codesandbox like [crazy](https://twitter.com/CompuIves/status/1052594462768148480), an idea came to my mind.

> **Can I build my website only using the browser?**

Now that I have had a small break, time to put that thought to the test. So, let us set the rules and exceptions.

### Rules

##### Browser is the only development environment I can use.

At no point in time should the code reside on any of my machines.

##### No cloning someone elses finished work.

No shortcuts beyond using a starter kit. I should be able to explain each and every line of the code.

##### Limited compromises compared to developing on my machine.

I realize that working only on the browser could've some limitations, but the whole point of this exercise is to find those limits. So, we can accept some workarounds, but nothing that compromises efficiency drastically.

##### I should be happy with the outcome.

I should like the website that I created.

### Exceptions

Images and any other static resource that I require can be stored on my machines. As long as I do not edit them.
